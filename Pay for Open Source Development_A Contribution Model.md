# Pay for Open Source Development (PFOSD): A Contribution Model

Open Source projects often run into the problem of being not as useful as closed-source, paid alternatives.

A solution to this problem could be allowing for monetary contributions behind issues/features/requests/changes, no matter what the size, users want to be implemented.

This gives the project's contributors a motivation to contribute for a monetary reward and ultimately push the project beyond its typical contributor and financial resources.

## Explanation:

PFOSD is implemented using a issue/feature management software typically hosted on a website.

### Users or companies can
- Create and document specific new issues and feature requests
- Commit their own monetary funds to the possible completion of requests

### Contributor individuals/teams can
- Commit to completing a request
- Be paid all of the contributions behind the request for all of the specifics of the request being fulfilled

## Problems With Current Open Source Development Contribution Models

PFOSD can be used as an additional contribution model all of these currently existing models.

### Company Managed, Company Funded Development
#### Examples
- React (Facebook)

#### Problems
This model is monetarily funded and usually yields the highest-quality product, but because it is company-managed, the company's priorities for development are going to come over the users'.

This can act as a detractor for users and can cause open or closed sourced alternatives to arise. This fragments the userbase the project and its offerings attract, creates decentralization and destandardization in the industry, and requires alternatives to re-develop and sometimes ironicly mirror development of the original/similar/competing product. It generates inefficencies for the industry as a whole.


### Community Managed
#### Majority Company Funded Development Examples
- OpenStreetMap
- Express.js
- Widely-used programming libraries

#### Majority Community Funded Development Examples
- Wikipedia Foundation
- Narrowly-used programming libraries (Sponsoring through Github, etc. )

#### Problems
Community Managed (nomatter waht the majority funding source), allows for monetary contributions as well, but is limited to the funding provided every year and the allocation of that funding decided by the leadership of that community.

Although the leadership is usually democratically-elected and aims to fulfill the community's interests and requests, not all requests will be fulfilled or some requests might be unknowingly misrepresented.


## Examples

### Chat Service
A hypothetical open source community managed public chat service does not display embeds based on the OpenGraph protocol when links are present in their messages (like Discord and Slack do). Their dedicated paid development team is small and wants to focus on larger backend development, such as currently building an API. Small, for-convenience features like these are not a priority.

However, the chat service has just implemented the PFOSD model using a custom wiki/forum that allows users post requests and donate contributions for the requests.

A user of the product recognizes the message embed shortfall of the service and decides to create a request for it on the forum.

A second user sees the posted request and decides to add some specifics to the request, such as using the OpenGraph protocol, so that if someone ever fulfills it, the request can be marked complete and the contributions paid.

A third user sees the posted request and decides to commit $5 to the request as they personally see the need and agree to both the request and it's specifics. They also configure their contribution to increase by $1 per month, knowing that it might speed up the time till completion.

10000 users see this request over a period time. 100 of them decide to donate $5 to its completion.

At this point, the request is one of the most-monetarily backed requests on the forum. The paid development team still does not see this as a priority so it is not developed.

However a team of 2 developers who commonly contribute to the project and know its codebase, see the monetary reward of the request and state that they can fulfill it.

They are given the default community-agreed time period of 2 weeks to deliver on the product request.

The developers finish the request in 1 week are are paid all of the contributions of request that were present at the time they first claimed the request. Because they area  team, they decide how to split up the reward.

If they hadn't completed the request in time, the next individual/team to have claimed request after them (a queue is established) and completed it will recieve all of the reward. Because they had not completed it on-time, any development efforts of the previous team will not be rewarded nomatter how much they contributed. The next team can use any of the prior development contributions of the previous team. For this reason, and transparency for the request supporters and community in-general, it is required that all development efforts are to be commited openly for the community to follow, use, and review.
